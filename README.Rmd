## Introduction

This package allows to extract [Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI)](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators). Two mains functions are built to perform this extraction. 

## Extraction

The extraction can be done for whole set of countries, or for specific list of countries or single country. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("Dzigbodi/WGIpkg")

```

The indicator 

```{r}
library(WGIpkg)
# Download Voice and Accountability represented by VAB
VAB_df<-load_wgi_indicator("VAB")

print(head(VAB_df))

```

Download the whole data set with six indicators

```{r}
df<-read_wgi(startyear = 2020, endyear = 2022)

print(head(df))
```
